# FA-2GL
we introduce a feature aggregation and association graph learning network (Fùê¥^2GL) for CDR, which aggregates intrinsic and interaction feature representations of drugs and cell lines, and obtains their network-level knowledge from the association graph.

# Environment
* python == 3.8.5
* pytorch == 1.6
* Numpy == 1.21.0
* scikit-learn == 0.23.2
* scipy == 1.5.0
* rdkit == 2020.03.6
* matplotlib == 3.3.1
* networkx == 2.5

# Run

```python
python FA2GL.py
```
